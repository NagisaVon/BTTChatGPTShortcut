-- The ChatGPT app can have a main window, usually named "ChatGPT" but could sometimes be different, when no chat bar is open, this would be window 1
-- And when you use the chat bar it will make another system dialog window, this will become the new window 1, and the main window will become window 2
-- This script will find the main window and the system dialog window if they exist and return the window object
